"""Keeping the routing prefix warm across prompts.

Every routing call asks a different question of the *same* candidate list — the
apex layer, re-rendered and re-sent on every prompt of every session. Today that
list is 1,311 tokens and the waste is affordable. The design has to survive
5,000 lessons, where at the current apex ratio it would be ~225k tokens per
prompt, and re-sending it each time is the difference between a working system
and an unusable one.

Providers already solve this, with prompt caching: an identical prefix is served
from cache at roughly a tenth of the price. The catch is that the prefix must
arrive as *the same conversation*, and a fresh `claude -p` is a new one every
time. So the candidate list is seeded once into a session, and each prompt
branches a throwaway fork from it. The fork answers against the stored prefix
without appending to it, so the next prompt finds the conversation exactly where
it was — one stable prefix, many questions, no transcript growth.

**Warmth is measured, never assumed.** Cache TTLs are not published per request
and vary with load and plan, so any local timer is a guess that will be wrong in
both directions — reseeding a prefix that was still warm, or forking against one
that has long expired. The provider reports `cache_read_input_tokens` on every
response, which is ground truth about whether the last call actually hit. This
module keeps the timer only as a cheap first filter and treats the observed
reads as the authority, widening or narrowing its own window from what it sees.

The catch, found the first time this ran against the real CLI: **most of that
number is not ours.** Claude Code sends a ~65k-token system prompt that the
provider caches regardless of anything ROSE does, so a naive "were tokens read
from cache?" test reports a hit on every single call, including the cold ones.
The candidate list — 690 tokens in that run — is a rounding error beside it.

So warmth is measured *per conversation*, against the two numbers its own
seeding call reported: what was already cached before our prefix existed, and
how many tokens of ours were written. A fork has hit when its read exceeds the
first by roughly the second.

A single global baseline was tried first and does not work — it drifts. Take the
maximum and one unusually warm seed poisons it into reporting permanent misses,
which is exactly what happened: a stale 65,372 baseline against a real
system-prompt read of 57,558 made every genuine hit come out negative. The
readings are only comparable within the conversation that produced them.

Which keeps the split: the harness measures and counts, and nothing here is a
judgement about meaning.
