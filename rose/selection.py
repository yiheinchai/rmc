"""Descent policy — *which child do we go to when the compressed lesson fails?*

The reason this question is hard is that compression normally destroys the
information you would need to invert it, so descent degenerates into trying
children at random and paying full price for the wrong one.

ROSE's answer is to make compression record its losses. Every compressed node
carries a delta manifest: the discrete claims that were removed, each attributed
to a descendant that still holds it. Descent is then a ranking problem over that
manifest rather than a search over the tree.

**The ranking itself is a model judgement**, not a similarity score. Whether a
particular omitted claim explains a particular failure is a question about
meaning: "parse the body, not the status code" is the fix for "treated HTTP 200
as success" while sharing almost no vocabulary with it. A lexical matcher gets
that exactly backwards, and a categorical `kind == category` join is a coarse
proxy for the same thing.

Two terms stay in code, because they are *evidence* rather than proxies for
judgement:

- ``prior`` — the Laplace-smoothed rate at which this node has actually rescued
  failures before. That is an observed outcome, not an inference about meaning,
  and it makes descent a contextual bandit over the tree.
- ``cost`` — token count. A measured fact.

    score = w_j · model_usefulness + w_p · prior − w_c · cost
