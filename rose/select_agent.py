"""Selection by search, run in a fork of the live session.

The judge-walk this replaces asks one question with every apex rendered into it.
That is affordable now and arithmetically impossible later: EXPERIMENTS §8 puts
a 5,000-lesson store at ~225k tokens of candidate list *per prompt*, at which
point the thing that decides what to load no longer fits beside the work. Prompt
caching changes the constant and not the shape.

So selection stops being a question about a rendered list and becomes a search
over a directory. Three consequences, and the third is the one that made the
fork the right process to run it in:

**Cost stops tracking the store.** The index is grepped, never sent. What costs
tokens per prompt is the selection-rule layer, capped by ``routing.max_tokens``.

**The candidate set stops being the apex layer.** EXPERIMENTS §8.2 found half
the store unreachable because a lesson below an apex could only be found by
descending into it. A grep does not care what level a lesson sits at.

**The selector gets the reasoning.** A fork inherits the whole conversation —
the task, the tool calls, what has already been tried. That is a far better
basis for "what does this work need" than the user's opening sentence, and it is
the input the reflection loop is defined over: task + tool calls + reasoning →
selected memories. Running selection anywhere else throws that away.

What this costs is latency, in a hook that blocks the user's prompt, and it is
not a small cost — EXPERIMENTS §4.4 records process startup alone at ~5s. The
answer is not to hope: it is ``recall.selector_max_tool_calls`` bounding the
search, ``recall.selector_timeout_s`` bounding the wait, and selection rules
collapsing the search over time. If that last part does not happen, this is
slower than what it replaced and the measurement should say so.
