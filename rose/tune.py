"""ROSE improving its own retrieval, without anyone supplying the ideas.

Every other stage of ROSE learns from outcomes. Compression is kept or rejected
by replay; a delta earns its way back by rescuing failures; consolidation is
driven by what got used together. The *judgement criteria* — the prompts and
constants that decide what gets recalled — were the one part that could only
change when a human thought of something.

That is the gap this closes. The loop is the same one a person runs by hand:

    measure  ->  read the failures  ->  propose one change  ->  measure again
             ->  keep it only if it wins  ->  remember the attempt either way

and it is worth automating because a person running it is wrong most of the
time. In the session that motivated this, five of six hand-written proposals
were regressions — each plausible, each argued for, each worse. The value is not
that the model has better ideas than the person. It is that neither of them gets
to decide, and the ones that lose are written down so nobody tries them twice.

The split is unchanged. The harness measures, applies, scores and reverts — all
mechanical. The model reads the failures and proposes what to change. The
recorded outcome decides. Nothing here asks a model whether its own idea worked.

**Only strict improvements are kept.** Precision is trivially bought by serving
less and recall by serving more, so a change has to be at least as good on both
before it counts. A trade is a preference, and preferences are the user's.

You are improving the retrieval stage of a memory system for coding agents. On
every prompt it decides which remembered lessons to put into the agent's
context. Two ways to be wrong, and both cost the user:

  - **noise** — a lesson was served and turned out not to bear on the work. It
    spent context and attention, and an irrelevant lesson can actively mislead.
  - **misses** — a lesson would have helped and was dropped. This is worse:
    the entire product claim is that the next session is shorter than the last.

Here is how the current criteria actually performed, scored against what a
later judgement said had really borne on the work.

CURRENT SCORE
{score}

WHERE IT WENT WRONG
{failures}

THE CRITERIA IN USE
<<<PROMPT
{prompt}
PROMPT>>>

TUNABLE CONSTANTS
{knobs}

ALREADY TRIED, AND THE RESULT
{history}

Propose exactly ONE change.

Read the failures before theorising. A change that does not follow from a
specific failure above is a guess, and guesses have a poor record here — of six
hand-written proposals to this same prompt, five made it worse, every one of
them plausible. The common shape of the mistake was buying a little less noise
by dropping lessons that mattered.

Do not repeat anything under ALREADY TRIED, and do not propose a variation whose
mechanism is the same as one that failed there.

If `kind` is `prompt`, return the complete replacement text in `text` — it is
written to disk verbatim and must keep every `{{placeholder}}` the original had.
If `kind` is `config`, give the dotted `key` and the new `value`.

`hypothesis` states what you expect to change and why, in one sentence, so that
it reads as a prediction that can turn out wrong.
