"""Measuring whether the thesis holds.

ROSE claims that a lesson can be compressed repeatedly and keep working. That is
falsifiable, and this is where it gets tested rather than asserted: replay real
tasks against every level of a lesson and see whether the shorter forms still
transfer.

The design choices here are all about making a *failure* visible, because an
eval that can only produce good news is a demo:

* **A control arm.** Every case is also run with no lesson at all. Without it
  you measure the model's prior, not the lesson — and a lesson that adds nothing
  looks identical to one that works.
* **A ceiling arm.** The original L0 sets what full detail achieves. Without it
  a low score at L2 cannot be told apart from a lesson that never helped.
* **Held-out episodes.** Compression is *accepted* by replaying episodes; scoring
  it on those same episodes measures memorisation. The split is deterministic
  and the compressor never sees the test half.
* **Blind grading.** The grader is shown the task, the known-good outcome and a
  candidate — never the lesson, and never which arm produced it. The ordinary
  replay judge takes the lesson as context, which would identify the control
  instantly by its absence.
* **Repeats.** A single sample per arm is a coin toss. Variance is reported, not
  hidden behind a mean.

Nothing here writes to the store. An eval that mutates what it measures is
measuring itself.
