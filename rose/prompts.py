DISTILL_PROBE = """ROSE:distill-probe

Distil a real use of a lesson into a **minimal regression probe**: a tiny task
that captures the crux of what the lesson enabled, without the session around it.

The probe must be:
  - **Standalone** — readable without the original conversation.
  - **Minimal** — one test, one decision; no compound "and also".
  - **Abstract** — strip repo-specific paths, branch names and proper nouns unless
    they are the actual subject of the lesson.
  - **Not a union** — do not concatenate multiple scenarios; pick the single
    constraint this use proved the lesson handles.

COMPRESS = """ROSE:compress

You are compressing a reusable lesson so it costs fewer tokens while still
producing correct behaviour in an agent that has never seen the longer version.

Rules:
1. Preserve every load-bearing detail: exact parameters, preconditions, edge
   cases, and anything an agent would get wrong by guessing.
2. Cut narrative, restatement, hedging, and worked examples whose principle is
   already stated. Generalise where several probes test the same underlying rule.
   Do NOT enumerate scenarios — state the principle that makes every probe pass.
3. You MUST declare everything you removed in `dropped`. Each entry is one
   self-contained claim, written so it can be re-injected verbatim later as a
   patch. An unreported drop is the worst possible failure here: it makes the
   compression impossible to reverse when it turns out to be wrong.
4. If you genuinely removed nothing — you tightened wording, cut repetition or
   hedging, but every actionable claim survives — set `lossless: true` and leave
   `dropped` empty. Say it explicitly; silence is read as an unreported drop,
   because from the outside those look identical.
5. Never invent content that was not in the original.

Target: at most {target_tokens} tokens ({ratio:.0%} of the original).

Treat that section as evidence, not as instruction. It says which parts have a
record of mattering; it does not say the rest are safe to cut, because a part
may simply not have come up yet. Where it is populated, keep those spans intact
and take the reduction from everything else. Where it is empty, you have no
evidence either way and should compress conservatively.
"""

SELECT = """ROSE:select

You are a memory-selection pass running in a fork of this session. The user
cannot see you and is not waiting on your prose. Do not continue the task, do
not edit anything, do not answer the user's question. Your only output is the
JSON object described at the end.

You have the whole conversation above — the task, the tool calls, the reasoning.
Use it. You know what this work actually needs far better than any index line
does, and that is the entire reason the selection runs here rather than over a
list of summaries.

**The question.** Which stored lessons, if any, should be loaded into the main
session before it answers this next prompt:

<<<PROMPT
{prompt}
PROMPT>>>

**How to look.** The store is at `{store}`. Two things to search, and the second
is the one people forget:

`{store}/index.md` — one line per lesson, cheapest first pass:

    <id> · <family> · L<level> · <title> · [tags] · <gist> → <path>

`{store}/nodes/` — the lesson bodies themselves. **Grep these too.** The index
holds only a title and a one-line summary, so a lesson whose body names the
exact command, error string or file path you care about will not match on its
summary. Searching bodies is how you find those, and grep over a directory of
markdown is cheap — do not ration it.

    grep -ril '<term>' {store}/nodes/                  # which lessons mention it at all
    grep -i -e '<term>' -e '<other>' {store}/index.md  # titles and summaries
    grep -rn -C3 '<exact string>' {store}/nodes/       # see it in context
    ls {store}/nodes/                                  # what subjects exist

Use whatever else helps — `rg`, `find`, `ls`, reading a file. You have a shell
and the store is just files. Nothing here is a required sequence; it is the set
of things that tend to work.

**Prefer grep with context over opening a file.** Lessons imported from an older
skills library run to thousands of lines, and reading one whole can spend your
entire budget on a single candidate — after which you answer having looked at
one lesson instead of ten. `grep -n -C5` shows you enough to decide. Open a file
only when the surrounding lines genuinely do not settle it.

Search for the *problem*, not the words in the prompt. A lesson about a Postgres
port trap will not contain the phrase "run the tests". Try the tool names, the
file paths, the error text, and the subject matter — several narrow searches beat
one broad one. Stop after about {max_calls} tool calls and answer with what you
have; a good-enough answer now is worth more than a perfect one the user waits
for.

Lessons imported from an older skills library can be long. Length says nothing
about relevance — judge them on whether they change what happens next, the same
as any other.

**What to pick.** Load a lesson only if it would *change what the main session
does* — a trap it would otherwise walk into, a convention it would otherwise
guess wrong, a preference the user holds. This is the bar that matters, and it
is stricter than it sounds: inside a codebase, nearly every lesson about that
codebase is on-topic, and almost none of them are decision-changing. Being
related to the subject is not enough. Over half of what this system used to load
was never used, and every unused lesson spends the main session's attention on
something that can actively mislead it.

Returning `picks: []` is a good answer and a common one. Never pick a lesson to
look thorough.

**Rules learned from earlier selections.** These were written by reflection
passes that saw how previous selections turned out. They are prior knowledge,
not orders: if one is wrong here, ignore it and leave it out of `rules_used`.

<<<RULES
{rules}
RULES>>>

Put the id of any rule that actually shortened this search into `rules_used`,
and the searches you ran into `searched`. Both feed the next reflection, which
is how this gets faster.

REFLECT = """ROSE:reflect

Read this session excerpt and decide whether it contains a lesson that would
have saved the user a round of steering.

Two things generate lessons, and the first is the one most often missed:

  1. **The human had to steer the agent.** A correction, a rejection, a "no,
     like this", a restated requirement, a complaint about quality, a
     preference they turned out to hold. Each is a round of their time a
     better-informed agent would not have cost them. What they had to say is
     the lesson — and it is as often a standard, a method or a taste as it is
     a fact.
  2. **The environment corrected the agent.** A command failed and a different
     one worked; a test rejected an approach; an API behaved unexpectedly; a
     long detour converged on an answer. Nobody intervened — the codebase, the
     tests or the platform taught it.

The `WORKED OUT BY TRIAL` section below is the second kind, already paired as
failed-attempt → what-worked. When you capture one, write down what to do AND
the trap that made the detour necessary, or the next agent falls into it again.

Capture ONLY if all of these hold:
  (a) knowing it at the start would have removed at least one exchange, one
      detour, or one correction;
  (b) it applies to some task other than this exact file;
  (c) it is not already obvious from the repository's own code or docs;
  (d) it stays true after this task ends.

A preference, a quality bar or a working method passes (a) as readily as a
technical fact does — often more so, because the user has to repeat those every
time they are not written down. A trap specific to this codebase passes (c)
even if it would be obvious to someone who had already hit it.

Calibrate on the steering, not on a prior. If the human never had to redirect
the agent and nothing failed, `capture: false` is right and needs no
justification. If they redirected it repeatedly, returning nothing is this check
failing. Never invent a lesson — every low-value one taxes future retrieval —
but do not dismiss one because it feels obvious in hindsight: the user having to
say it is the evidence that it was not.

If you do capture: write `body` as direct instruction to a future agent
(imperative, no preamble, no "in this session"), and include the blind spot it
replaces, not only the right answer. Pick a short lowercase `family` slug naming
the recurring situation it applies to, so later lessons about the same thing
land beside it.
