"""Selection lessons: ROSE applied to its own retrieval.

Every other stage of ROSE learns from outcomes. Retrieval — the stage that
decides what enters the user's context on every prompt — learned from nothing,
and it is the one measured to be worst: 48% precision after filtering
(EXPERIMENTS §4.1), meaning over half of what recall serves is never used.

A selection lesson is what the reflector writes after watching a session: not
knowledge about the work, but knowledge about *where the knowledge was*. "When
the task touches the integration tests, read `nodes/testing/` before running
anything." The next selector reads that and reaches the right set in fewer tool
calls, or skips a search it now knows is fruitless.

Three properties make this layer different from the lesson tree, and each is
load-bearing:

**They live outside `nodes/`.** If selection lessons were nodes they would be
retrieved by the very mechanism they exist to fix, and would compete with real
lessons for the same injection budget. They are always injected instead, under
their own cap.

**They must be conditioned on a task type.** EXPERIMENTS §4.2 already measured
the unconditioned form: annotating candidates with their track record ("shown
5x, never used") dropped precision to 41% and recall to 81% — worse on both.
The recorded reason is that "low usage is a statement about the distribution of
work, not the lesson". So a rule with no `when` is rejected here rather than
stored and hoped for. That check is also what keeps the layer from growing 1:1
with the store: "n_abc is rarely useful" is one rule per lesson, while "when the
task touches X, look in Y" is one rule per *kind of work*.

**The layer is capped, and the cap is enforced by eviction, not by hope.** The
claim that selection lessons are far fewer than memories is a bet, not a
guarantee. ``growth`` reports the ratio so the bet is visible as a number, and
``fit`` drops the least useful rules when the cap binds.
