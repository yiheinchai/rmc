"""Turning a finished session into store updates.

Three steps, in order of cost:

``observe``  — one judgement. The model reads the session and says how it went,
               whether the human had to steer, and what was worked out by trial.
               Node statistics, the episode record and ambient descent all key
               off that verdict.
``descend``  — free when nothing was dropped; otherwise one judgement about
               which omitted detail the correction was really about.
``mint``     — one judgement. Only when the session contains something reusable,
               followed by reconciliation against what is already known.

A structural gate comes first: a session with two tool calls and no follow-up is
skipped without asking anything. That is a question about size, not meaning, so
it stays in code.
