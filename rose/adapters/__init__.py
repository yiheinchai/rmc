"""Execution backends. One interface, three implementations.

ROSE needs to spawn *fresh* agent processes for two jobs:

1. meta-calls (compress, diagnose, judge) — no tools, structured output;
2. replay (re-run a recorded task against a candidate lesson) — tools on.

Every spawned process gets ``ROSE_CHILD=1`` in its environment. ROSE's own hooks
check that variable and no-op, which is the only thing preventing a compression
run from recursively triggering compression runs.
