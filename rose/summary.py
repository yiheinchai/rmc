"""The routing view of a lesson: its title and its one-line gist.

The relevance walk reads title and gist and never the body — sending 700
characters per candidate to decide which candidates to send is the scaling bug
the design exists to avoid. That makes these two fields load-bearing for
retrieval, not decoration.

They were only ever written on two paths: a lesson minted by the reflector, and
a nightly backfill during `dream`. Everything else left them empty or stale:

* `rose add` wrote neither, so a lesson taught directly routed on a truncated
  head of its own body until a dream happened to run — and dream is gated on
  elapsed time *and* new episodes, so that can be days, or never.
* A fold merged two bodies and kept the survivor's title, so a lesson could
  grow past its own name. One here ended up leading with "the customer's
  experience defines the value of a product" while still advertising itself as
  "walk the whole flow as a stranger before shipping it" — correct content,
  wrong label, and the router only sees the label.

So the summary is written whenever the body it describes changes.

Write the routing view of this lesson: the two lines a future agent sees when
deciding whether to open it at all.

`title` — a short noun phrase naming the claim, not the topic. It is what a
reader scans in a list of twenty. Prefer the specific over the general: name the
tool, command, service or failure it concerns.

`gist` — one line, at most 25 words, naming what the lesson is about and *when
it applies*. Do not summarise the advice; identify the situation that should
make someone reach for it.
