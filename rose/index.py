"""The store index: what a selector greps instead of what a router is sent.

Routing used to work by rendering every apex into one question. That is
affordable at 29 lessons and impossible at 5,000: at ~55 tokens per apex, and
with apex count tracking node count roughly 1:1 (EXPERIMENTS §3.4), the
candidate list alone reaches ~225k tokens *per prompt*. No amount of prompt
caching fixes a list that no longer fits.

The way out is to stop sending the list at all. This module writes one line per
lesson to ``.rose/index.md`` — id, family, level, title, tags, gist, path — and
the selector searches that file with grep rather than reading it into a prompt.

The distinction is the whole scaling argument, so it is worth stating flatly:

    the index is a file that is *searched*, never text that is *injected*.

At 5,000 lessons it is roughly 125k tokens on disk and exactly zero tokens per
prompt. What costs tokens per prompt is the selection-lesson layer, which is
bounded by ``routing.max_tokens`` and does not grow with the store.

**This is a first pass, not the only surface.** The index holds a title and a
one-line summary, so a lesson whose *body* names the exact command or error
string will not match on its summary — and after a verbatim skills migration
most of what a store knows lives in bodies thousands of lines long. The selector
is told to grep ``nodes/`` as well, and to use whatever else the shell offers.
Nothing here is a boundary on where it may look; it is the cheapest place to
look first.

One line per node, one node per line, no wrapping: the format exists to be
matched by `grep`, and a claim that spans two lines is a claim grep will cut in
half. Everything a search might key on is on the same line as the id needed to
open the file.
