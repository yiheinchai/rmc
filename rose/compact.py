"""Compression: generate a shorter lesson, then earn the right to keep it.

The acceptance gate is the check from the original design sketch — spawn a fresh
agent, give it the task plus the compressed lesson, see whether you still get the
right output — hardened in three ways:

1. **Fresh process.** Validation runs in a new `claude -p` / `codex exec`, so the
   only thing carrying knowledge is the lesson text. Validating inside the main
   agent's context leaks its memory of the verbose lesson and every compression
   looks successful.
2. **Subtree-wide regression set.** Validating only against the episode that
   triggered the compression is how you get a beautifully compressed, useless
   tree. The set is the union over the node's whole subtree.
3. **Rejections are informative.** A rejected candidate records which episodes
   failed; those become `preserve:` hints for the next attempt, so the
   compressor converges instead of thrashing.
