"""Bringing an existing skills library into ROSE.

People who need ROSE have usually already built a worse version of it by hand.
The common shape is a directory of Claude or Codex skills grown by
introspection: an agent notices it learned something, writes a `SKILL.md`, and a
companion skill keeps an index of them. It works, and it has three costs ROSE
exists to remove.

* **Recall is manual.** A skill fires when its `description` matches what the
  user typed, or when the agent remembers to reach for it. Knowledge that is
  not recognised is not retrieved, and nobody finds out.
* **Nothing consolidates.** Twenty skills that share a procedure stay twenty
  skills, and each keeps every line it ever accumulated.
* **Nothing is scored.** A skill that has never once changed an outcome is
  indistinguishable from the one that saves an hour a week.

**Migration is a file conversion, and deliberately nothing more.** One skill
becomes one lesson: the body copied byte for byte, `description` becoming the
gist, `name` the title, the directory name the family. No model call, no
splitting, no rewriting. A library of 5,000 lines imports for the cost of
reading 5,000 lines off disk.

This is a reversal, and the reasoning behind the previous design is worth
recording because it was not silly — it was aimed at the wrong constraint.

The old path asked a model to split each skill into atomic lessons, on the
argument that a skill is several claims in a trench coat while a lesson is one
claim plus its trigger. That was true, and it cost a model call per skill, and
every one of those calls was a chance to paraphrase away the exact flag, the
exact error string, the exact constant — the things that make a lesson worth
retrieving at all. Twenty-four skills became a hundred and twenty-two lessons
that no longer said quite what the originals said.

The constraint it was solving was retrieval: a long document was expensive to
route and hard to match. Both halves of that have since gone away.

* Selection is a **search** now, not a rendered candidate list, so a long lesson
  costs nothing to route past. Length stopped being a retrieval tax.
* Compaction is driven by **observed use**, so a lesson that turns out to be
  four-fifths padding gets cut down by evidence rather than by a guess made at
  import time, before anything is known about which parts matter.

So the right thing to import is the original, unedited, and let the system that
measures which parts do work be the thing that shortens it. Import cheaply,
condense on evidence.

**Nothing is deleted.** Migration only ever adds. What to remove afterwards is
the user's call, made once they can see that ROSE recalls the same knowledge.

# Skills whose subject is *writing and maintaining skills*. Importing these
# fills a new memory with instructions for operating the system being replaced.
#
# A name list, not a judgement — which is why it is visible here, printed in the
# report, and overridable with `--all`. The alternative was a model call per
# skill to decide, which is most of the cost this rewrite removes, spent on the
# easiest question in the process.
#
# **The list is deliberately narrow, and errs toward importing.** A first draft
# included `sync-repos` and `handoff` on the strength of their names; the first
# clones git repositories and the second writes a runbook for a human, and both
# are exactly the kind of hard-won procedure worth keeping. Wrongly importing
# something costs a lesson nobody retrieves. Wrongly skipping one loses
# knowledge silently, and the user has no reason to go looking for it. So a name
# only belongs here if it cannot plausibly mean anything but skill-writing.
