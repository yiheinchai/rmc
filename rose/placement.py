"""Where does a newly learned lesson go?

Growing the tree is not just "append a leaf". When something is learned — by
human teaching or by self-discovery — it has to be reconciled with what is
already known, and there are five genuinely different answers:

| Relation | What it means | What we do |
|---|---|---|
| `duplicate` | already known, no new information | nothing; record the hit |
| `refines` | same topic, adds detail the tree lacks | fold into the L0 node; patch ancestors |
| `contradicts` | same topic, incompatible claim | keep both, mark disputed, ask the human |
| `specialises` | same topic, a distinct case | attach as a sibling; merge-compression may later generalise both |
| `orthogonal` | unrelated | new family — a brand new leaf |

The interesting one is `contradicts`. Silently overwriting is how a memory
system rots: whichever lesson was written last wins, regardless of which is
true. Instead the contradiction is recorded on the node and surfaced **at recall
time**, when the user is already thinking about that topic — the same reason a
student raises a confusion during the lesson it belongs to rather than at random.

Both judgements here are the model's: which remembered lessons cover the same
subject, and how the new one relates to them. Neither is a similarity score —
two lessons about the same service can share no vocabulary, and two that share
their most distinctive word can be about unrelated systems.

Efficiency comes from the tree, not from cheap approximations. Apexes are the
most compressed nodes in the store, so the whole top level fits in one question;
only lines the model cannot judge from a summary are opened further; every
candidate is reconciled in a single call; and verdicts are cached.

RECONCILE = """ROSE:reconcile

A new lesson has been learned. Decide how it relates to what is already in
memory, so it can be filed correctly instead of blindly appended.

You are shown several existing lessons. Pick the ONE it most relates to and put
its id in `match`, then classify the relation. If it relates to none of them,
set `match` to an empty string and `relation` to `orthogonal`.

Pick exactly one relation:

- `duplicate`   — the new lesson says nothing the existing one does not already
                  say. Wording differences do not count as new information.
- `refines`     — same subject, and the new lesson adds detail, a constraint, or
                  a case the existing one lacks. The two are compatible.
- `contradicts` — same subject, and they cannot both be true. One tells an agent
                  to do something the other forbids, or they state different
                  values for the same thing.
- `specialises` — same general subject, but the new lesson is about a distinct
                  case that deserves to stand alongside rather than merge in.
- `orthogonal`  — different subject; the topical overlap is superficial.

Be strict about `contradicts`: it means genuinely incompatible, not merely
different emphasis. When you do pick it, `question` must be the single question
a human could answer to settle which is right — concrete and answerable in one
sentence, e.g. "Was the port changed to 5433 permanently, or only while
legacy-pg was running?"

For `refines`, return `merged_body`: the matched lesson rewritten to carry the
new detail. Keep every load-bearing claim from both. Do not pad it.
