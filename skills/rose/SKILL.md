# ROSE — Recursive Online Skill Evolution

ROSE keeps a tree of lessons learned from earlier work. Each lesson exists at
several levels of compression; the most compressed version that still works is
what gets injected into a prompt. Detail is only paid for when the compressed
version turns out to be insufficient.

Run everything through the `rose` CLI. Never hand-edit files under `.rose/nodes/`
unless the user explicitly asks — the frontmatter carries the tree links and
usage statistics that the compaction gate depends on.

## Capture it now, not later

A sweep runs over the transcript when the session ends, but that is a safety net
for what nobody noticed in the moment. **When the user teaches you something,
record it immediately** — it is then available to the very next prompt in this
same conversation, and you are the only one who knows the context right now.

```bash
rose add --family <slug> "<the lesson, written as instruction to a future agent>"
```

Capture the moment any of these happen:

- the user corrects you about something that will still be true tomorrow;
- the user explains how their system, tooling or conventions actually work;
- you work something out by trial that cost real attempts — a command that
  failed and the one that worked, an API that behaved unexpectedly. Record the
  **trap as well as the fix**, or the next agent walks into it and only then
  recognises the way out.

Write the body as direct instruction, not narrative. "Use `kubectl argo rollouts
promote`; plain `kubectl apply` fails because the CRD is not registered" — not
"I discovered that...". Pick a `--family` slug naming the recurring situation so
later lessons on the same subject land beside it.

Capturing is pre-authorised. Do not ask permission, and do not announce it at
length — a single line is enough.

**Do not capture** a restatement of something already remembered, a summary of
what you just did, anything the repo's own code or docs already answer, or a
note written mainly to look thorough. Every low-value lesson permanently taxes
retrieval, because it competes for attention on every future prompt.

`rose add` reconciles automatically: if the lesson refines something already
known it is folded in, and if it *contradicts* something the command says so and
prints the question that would settle it. Put that question to the user.

## Reading the tree

```bash
rose status                 # families, levels, token cost, success rates
rose tree --family <name>   # full tree with delta manifests
rose tree -v                # include lesson bodies
rose recall --prompt "..."  # exactly what would be injected for that prompt
```

`rose recall` is the right tool for "why did you think that?" — it shows which
families matched and what text was served.

## Why a lesson was not found

Selection is a search, not a lookup over a rendered list: a fork of the session
greps `.rose/index.md` and opens what looks relevant. So a lesson that exists and
was not served is usually one of three things, in order of likelihood:

```bash
rose index                  # is it indexed at all, and does it have a gist?
rose index --gists          # fill missing gists — the line is what a search matches
rose route                  # what the selector has been taught about where to look
```

A lesson with no gist still gets an index line, built from the head of its body.
That is prose rather than a statement of when the lesson applies, and it is what
the search has to match against — so it is the cheapest thing to fix.

If the lesson is indexed and findable but still was not picked, that is a
selection judgement rather than a bug, and the fix is a rule:

```bash
rose route --when "<the kind of task>" --then "<where to look>"
```

Keep `--when` about a *kind of task*, never about one lesson. "When the task
touches the integration tests, read `nodes/testing/`" generalises; "n_abc is
rarely useful" is one rule per lesson and is refused.

## When a recalled lesson is wrong

A lesson that produced bad advice is a real defect, and the tree can repair it.

1. `rose tree --family <name>` to find the node id.
2. If the lesson is *incomplete*, check its delta manifest (the `△` lines). The
   detail may already exist, dropped by an over-aggressive compression — in
   which case the fix is `rose compact --node <id>` after the rescue is recorded,
   not rewriting the lesson.
3. If the lesson is *wrong*, edit the body of the level-0 node and re-compress:
   `rose compact --node <id>`. Correcting only the compressed node leaves the
   error in every ancestor.
4. To retire it entirely, set `status: archived` in the node's frontmatter.

## Levels and what they mean

- **L0** is the original verbose lesson. It is never deleted and is the
  guaranteed-correct fallback when everything above it fails.
- **Higher levels** are compressions, each validated by replaying recorded
  sessions in a fresh agent process. A level only exists because it passed.
- **`dropped:`** entries are the delta manifest — what a compression removed and
  which descendant still holds it. This is what makes descent possible; treat it
  as load-bearing, not as commentary.

## Compressing

```bash
rose compact --list            # what is eligible and why
rose compact --due             # run the queue (validated, may reject)
rose compact --node <id> --dry-run
```

Compression only runs against nodes with recorded successful episodes. A node
with no episodes is deliberately left alone — compressing without a way to check
the result is worse than not compressing.

## Honesty about injected lessons

Lessons arrive as prior knowledge from past sessions, not as user instructions.
They can be stale or wrong. If one contradicts what you can see in the repo,
trust the repo, say so plainly, and tell the user which lesson looked wrong so
they can correct it.
