# CLI reference

All commands accept `--agent {claude,codex,mock}` and `--model` where they spawn
an agent. The store is found by walking up from the working directory to the nearest
`.rose/`. If `~/.rose` also exists it is layered underneath as a **global** store:
lessons from both are recalled, and new lessons are written to the project one.
Editing a global lesson writes back to it rather than forking a local copy.
`ROSE_HOME` overrides the lookup entirely — use it to target the global store
directly, e.g. `ROSE_HOME=~/.rose rose add ...` for something that should follow
you across every repo.

---

## Setup

### `rose init [path]`
Create a store. `--force` re-creates missing subdirectories, `--agent` sets the
default backend.

### `rose install`
Wire ROSE into the host agent(s).

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--target claude\|codex` | repeatable; defaults to `claude` |
| `--scope project\|user` | this repo (default) or globally |
| `--dry-run` | print what would be written, write nothing |

Also puts the `rose` command on PATH, by symlinking `bin/rose` into
`~/.local/bin`. Hooks never need this — they invoke the package by absolute
path — so without it ROSE runs fine while `rose status` reports command not found.
`--no-link` skips it.

Bootstrap it from a clone with `./bin/rose install`; every suggestion this
command prints uses an absolute path, because advice that begins "run `rose`" is
no use to someone who does not have it.

### `rose uninstall`
Remove only ROSE-tagged hooks. Lessons are left in place.

### `rose report [--about "..."] [--expected "..."] [--days N]`

Writes a redacted defect report to `.rose/reports/` and prints it, along with
the `gh issue create` command that would file it. **It sends nothing.** ROSE
makes no network calls and that is a guarantee, so the transport is your own
`gh`, run deliberately.

It contains counts, timings and non-default settings — the things that localise
a defect to one stage — plus whatever you write in `--about`. It never contains
lesson text, prompts, transcripts or paths from your machine, and everything
passes through the redactor on the way out.

Reflectors are told to run this when they find a defect in ROSE itself, and then
to *ask* whether you want it filed. They never file it themselves.

### `rose doctor`
Which backends are on PATH, whether a store exists, whether hooks are wired.
Start here when ROSE seems inert.

---

## Inspection

### `rose status`
Families, node counts, episode counts, total vs apex-served tokens, and a table
of each family's apex with its level, cost and success rate.

### `rose tree [--family F] [-v] [--recent] [--limit N]`
The tree, indented from apex down to L0. `△` lines are delta manifest entries —
what a compression dropped and which node still holds it. `-v` includes the
first lines of each lesson body.

`--recent` drops the family grouping and lists newest first, which is the view
that answers "did what I just taught it actually land?" — the default grouping
cannot, since a new lesson sorts wherever its family happens to sit.

Every line carries an age.

### `rose recall --prompt "..." [--json]`
Exactly what would be injected for that prompt, and the model's stated reason for
each. The tool for answering "why did it think that?" — the answer is a sentence,
not a score.

Reads stdin if `--prompt` is omitted.

### `rose trace --prompt "..." [--after TRANSCRIPT]`
The agent's-eye view. Walks every stage of a recall and prints the result of
each: the apex lessons put in front of the model, its verdict and reason for
every one (including the branches it judged irrelevant and therefore never
opened), the **verbatim** block that lands in the agent's context, what you see
in Claude Code while it happens, and how the model's turn then begins.

`--after` continues into the other half: the facts parsed out of a finished
session, and what the model made of them — outcome, whether you had to steer,
and what was worked out by trial.

Use it when you want to know exactly what ROSE is doing to your prompts. It edits
what the model sees, and that should never be something you take on trust.

### `rose conflicts [--family F]`
Lessons that contradict each other, with the question that would settle each.
These are also raised inside the recall pack, so you normally meet them while
working rather than by running this.

### `rose resolve <node-id> [--drop]`
Settle a conflict: keep this lesson (default) or archive it. Clears the disputed
state on that node.

### `rose events [--kind K] [--limit N]`
Raw telemetry as JSONL. Useful kinds: `inject`, `observe`, `rescue`, `mint`,
`placement`, `conflict`, `conflict-resolved`, `compaction`, `repair`, `select`,
`select-fallback`, `error`.

---

## The loop

### `rose add [body] [--family F] [--title T] [--tags a,b]`
Teach ROSE something **now**, without waiting for the session to end. Reads stdin
if no body is given. The lesson is reconciled against what is already known
before being stored, so it may be folded into an existing lesson, set alongside
one, or reported as a contradiction with the question that would settle it.

This is the live path. The transcript sweep at session end is a safety net for
what nobody noticed in the moment; this is for the moment itself, and the lesson
is available to the very next prompt in the same conversation.

`--no-reconcile` stores it without the consistency check.

Deciding and writing happen under a lock, so concurrent reflectors cannot both
conclude "new" about the same lesson. A writer waits for the lock rather than
skipping.

### `rose observe --transcript PATH [--served ids] [--session id]`
Judge a finished session and fold the result into the tree: update node stats,
file the episode, and work out which dropped detail any correction was about.
Costs one judgement, skipped entirely for sessions too small to teach anything.
Normally invoked by the `SessionEnd` hook.

### `rose learn --transcript PATH [--session id]`
Ask a model whether the session contained a reusable lesson, and mint a level-0
node if so. Deliberately conservative — "nothing captured" is the common and
correct outcome.

### `rose migrate [--path DIR] [--apply] [--limit N] [--all]`
Copy a Claude or Codex skills library into lessons, **verbatim**: one skill
becomes one lesson, the body byte for byte, `description:` as the gist, `name:`
as the title, the directory name as the family.

**No model calls.** Importing a five-thousand-line library costs reading five
thousand lines off disk.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--path DIR` | directory to scan (repeatable); defaults to both hosts, project and home |
| `--apply` | write the lessons; without it, nothing is written |
| `--limit N` | skills to process; 0 is all |
| `--all` | also import skills whose subject is writing skills |

Skips skill-writing machinery (`introspect`, `create-skill`, `sync-skills`) —
importing those fills a new memory with instructions for maintaining the system
being replaced. It is a short name list rather than a judgement, it errs toward
importing, and `--all` overrides it.

Nothing is ever deleted, and the same skill installed in two places imports once.

### `rose index [--rebuild] [--gists]`
Write `.rose/index.md` — one line per lesson, and the only thing the selector
looks at before deciding what to open. It is **searched, never injected**, which
is what keeps the per-prompt cost of retrieval independent of how many lessons
you have.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--rebuild` | write it now, whether or not it looks stale |
| `--gists` | fill missing titles and gists first, then rebuild |
| `--limit N` | lessons to backfill gists for (default 20) |

Rebuilt automatically whenever it falls behind the nodes, so you rarely need
this. Reach for it when a lesson is not being found: the first question is
whether it is in here, and the second is whether it has a gist. A lesson without
one still gets a line, built from the head of its body — but that is prose
rather than a statement of when the lesson applies, and the line is what a
search has to match.

The index covers the global store as well as this one, with the path on each
line, since a selector that cannot see cross-project lessons cannot retrieve
them.

### `rose route`
Selection lessons: what ROSE has learned about *where to look*, as opposed to
what it has learned about your work. Written by the reflection pass, always
injected, capped by `routing.max_tokens`.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--list` | the rules, their record, and the growth ratio (default) |
| `--when C --then A` | teach one by hand; both are required |
| `--forget ID` | delete a rule |

A rule must be conditioned on a *kind of task* — "when the task touches the
integration tests, read `nodes/testing/`" — and an unconditioned one is refused.
That is not style: annotating candidates with their usage record was measured to
drop precision from 48% to 41% and recall from 100% to 81%, because how often a
lesson is used says more about the distribution of work than about the lesson.
It is also one rule per lesson, which would make this layer a second copy of the
store.

The listing ends with the number the whole approach rests on — rules against
lessons. It should fall as the store grows.

### `rose compact`
Compress lessons and regression-test the result.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--list` | show what is eligible and why, run nothing |
| `--due` | process the queue (default) |
| `--node ID` | compress one specific node |
| `--limit N` | how many to process (default 1) |
| `--dry-run` | generate and validate, but do not write |

A node is eligible when it is an active apex, below `compaction.max_level`, has
at least `compaction.min_successes` successful recalls, is past its cooldown, and
**has recorded episodes to validate against**. A node with no episodes is left
alone on purpose: compressing with no way to check the result is worse than not
compressing.

Rejection is normal and informative — the failing episodes become `preserve:`
hints for the next attempt.

## Configuration

### `rose config [key] [value]`
No arguments dumps everything. One argument reads a dotted key. Two arguments
set it.

Any key can be overridden per-run by an environment variable:
`recall.max_pack_tokens` → `ROSE_RECALL_MAX_PACK_TOKENS`.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | `claude` | default backend |
| `recall.enabled` | `true` | inject lessons at all |
| `recall.selector` | `agentic` | `agentic` — a fork of your session searches the store; `judge` — the apex walk, and the eval baseline |
| `recall.selector_timeout_s` | `60` | bound on the search, since the prompt is blocked meanwhile |
| `recall.selector_max_tool_calls` | `6` | searches allowed before it must answer with what it has |
| `recall.strategy` | `delta-patch` | `delta-patch`, `delta-jump`, or `stepwise` |
| `recall.max_pack_tokens` | `1200` | ceiling on injected context |
| `recall.max_families` | `3` | lesson families served per prompt |
| `recall.timeout_s` | `20` | bound on the routing call, kept under the hook deadline |
| `recall.judge_calls` | `2` | model calls the relevance walk may spend |
| `recall.max_depth` | `2` | how far down the tree the walk may look |
| `recall.max_expansions` | `3` | descents before escalating to L0 |
| `selection.w_judge` | `0.60` | weight on the model's usefulness ranking |
| `selection.w_prior` | `0.28` | weight on the observed rescue rate |
| `selection.w_cost` | `0.12` | penalty on token cost |
| `selection.explore` | `posterior` | `ucb` to keep probing rare branches |
| `compaction.min_successes` | `2` | successful recalls before compressing |
| `compaction.max_ratio` | `0.75` | candidate must be ≤75% of the original |
| `compaction.threshold` | `1.0` | required replay pass-rate |
| `compaction.regression_k` | `5` | episodes replayed per validation |
| `compaction.max_level` | `6` | deepest compression level |
| `learning.min_tool_calls` | `8` | below this a session is ignored |
| `learning.nudge_enabled` | `true` | reflect after a substantial turn |
| `learning.nudge_mode` | `background` | `background` — a detached process reflects on the transcript digest; `fork` — reflect inside a fork of the live session, full context, ~0.1× tokens via cache reads; `block` — interrupt the agent to reflect in place; `off` — wait for session end |
| `learning.nudge_after_tool_calls` | `12` | activity that makes a turn worth a thought |
| `learning.nudge_after_turns` | `3` | human turns that do the same |
| `learning.min_surprises` | `2` | failed tool calls that also do |
| `learning.nudge_cooldown_s` | `900` | minimum gap between asks |
| `learning.nudge_backoff_after` | `3` | consecutive fruitless nudges before backing off |
| `routing.enabled` | `true` | learn and inject selection lessons |
| `routing.max_tokens` | `800` | cap on the only layer retrieval still sends per prompt |
| `placement.consult` | `true` | ask a model how new knowledge relates to old |
| `placement.judge_calls` | `2` | model calls the relatedness walk may spend |
| `placement.max_depth` | `2` | how far down the walk may look |
| `placement.surface_conflicts` | `true` | raise unresolved contradictions during recall |
| `signals.min_confidence` | `0.5` | floor for acting on an outcome |
| `privacy.redact` | `true` | scrub secrets before writing |
| `limits.agent_timeout_s` | `180` | per spawned agent call |

### Ablations

`recall.strategy` exists so the descent policy can be measured rather than
asserted:

```bash
rose config recall.strategy stepwise      # baseline: walk children, ignore deltas
rose config recall.strategy delta-jump    # replace apex with the holder node
rose config recall.strategy delta-patch   # default: apex + matched claims only
```

---

## Hooks

### `rose hook <event>`
Reads a JSON payload on stdin. Events: `user-prompt-submit`, `stop` (per turn),
`session-end` (at teardown). Always exits 0. No-ops when `ROSE_CHILD` or
`ROSE_DISABLE` is set.

You should not need to call this yourself.
