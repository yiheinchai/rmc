# Integration

How ROSE attaches to Claude Code and Codex, and what it writes where.

---

## Claude Code

### As a plugin (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add yiheinchai/rose
/plugin install rose@rose
```

The plugin ships the hooks, the `rose` skill and the `/rose` command.
Hook commands resolve through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/rose`, so nothing needs
to be on your `PATH` and no Python environment is required.

### By hand

```bash
rose install --target claude                 # this repo only
rose install --target claude --scope user    # every repo
rose install --target claude --dry-run       # show what it would write
```

This edits `.claude/settings.json` (or `~/.claude/settings.json`) additively.
Each entry ROSE adds is tagged `"_rose": true`, and `rose uninstall` removes only
tagged entries — hooks you configured yourself are left alone.

### Hooks used

| Event | Command | Purpose | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `rose hook user-prompt-submit` | serve the lessons that bear on this prompt | 30s; instant while the store fits the budget |
| `Stop` | `rose hook stop` | after a substantial turn, reflect — off-thread by default | 15s, nothing inline |
| `SessionEnd` | `rose hook session-end` | parse the transcript, then detach the whole learner | 30s; returns in ~0.1s, always |

`UserPromptSubmit` returns:

```json
{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
                        "additionalContext": "## Recalled lessons (ROSE) …"}}
```

Injected text is explicitly framed as prior knowledge rather than user
instruction, so a stale lesson cannot impersonate a request.

### Seeing it happen

An injection is never silent. While the hook runs you see its status line, and
when it injects, the hook returns a `systemMessage` that Claude Code shows you:

```
⋯ Recalling lessons…
⋯ ROSE · recalled 2 lessons (312 tok): retry, k8s-deploys   +1 patch
```

Unresolved contradictions are flagged there too. For the full picture — what was
offered to the model, what it decided and why, and the exact text injected — run
`rose trace --prompt "..."`.

Recall costs a model call on the hot path **only once the store outgrows
`max_pack_tokens`**. Below that everything is served unfiltered, with no call at
all, in milliseconds — there is nothing to choose between. That is deliberate — injecting the
wrong lesson is worse than injecting none, and only a reader can tell the
difference — but it is a real latency cost, so it is cached by prompt and can be
switched off with `rose config recall.enabled false`.

### Where reflection runs

`learning.nudge_mode` picks the trade:

| Mode | Context the reflector sees | Cost | Interrupts you |
|---|---|---|---|
| `background` (default) | a transcript digest, ~3k tokens | one small call | no |
| `fork` | the whole session, inherited | ~0.1× its tokens via cache reads | no |
| `block` | the agent's own live context | none extra | **yes** — one turn |
| `off` | — | none until session end | no |

`fork` spawns `claude --resume <id> --fork-session` detached. `--fork-session`
allocates a new session id, so the live session is never written to. It is
affordable because prompt-cache reads bill at **0.1×** and the cache keys on
prefix *content* rather than session identity — the fork hits what the live
session just wrote. Claude Code uses a 1-hour cache TTL, which covers the
reflection cooldown comfortably.

It is not the default because 10% of a very large context still exceeds a 3k
digest, and the digest has proven able to identify conceptual corrections rather
than only mechanical ones. Pick `fork` when fidelity matters more than tokens —
the digest necessarily drops nuance, and a conceptual mistake can live in the
nuance.

Every spawned reflector runs with `ROSE_CHILD=1`; without it the fork fires these
same hooks and forks itself, forever.

### Overlapping reflectors

Reflectors can overlap — a slow one can still be running when the next fires.
They are not prevented from doing so, because two reflectors looking at
different windows may legitimately find different things.

What is prevented is recording the same lesson twice, and the defence is
**reconciliation, not scheduling**. Every capture is checked against what is
already known and a duplicate is stored as nothing. A minimum time apart would
not achieve this: whatever gap you pick, a reflector that outlives it reopens
the race, and two reflectors an hour apart can still reach the same conclusion.

The one thing scheduling cannot fix is a *read-decide-write* race: if both
reflectors read the store before either writes, both conclude "new". So
`rose add` holds a write lock across decide-and-write, and a writer **waits**
for it rather than skipping — losing the lock and giving up would silently drop
a lesson. Stale locks (from a killed reflector) expire rather than wedging the
store.

`rose absorb` additionally takes a lock of its own and *skips* if another absorb
holds it, since two digest passes over the same transcript would only duplicate
work.

### Failure behaviour

Every hook path is wrapped and returns exit 0. A broken store, an unparseable
transcript or a raised exception all degrade to "inject nothing" rather than
interrupting the session. This is deliberate: a memory system that can break
someone's editor will be uninstalled, and correctly so.

`SessionEnd` gets a stricter rule still. The host is shutting down and will
cancel a hook that is still running, so slow work there is not late — it never
happens. Judging a session takes a model call, so the hook does none of it: it
parses the transcript, decides whether the session is even worth learning from,
and hands everything else to a detached `rose absorb`. It returns in about 0.1s.

`absorb` runs judge → learn → compress in that order, in one process. They were
briefly three parallel spawns, which raced: compaction is only eligible once the
judgement has recorded the successes that make a node due, so it usually lost.

## Codex

Codex's hook schema is less settled than Claude Code's, so the reliable route is
an instruction block appended to `AGENTS.md`:

```bash
rose install --target codex
```

which appends a marked block telling the agent to run `rose recall --prompt "…"`
before non-trivial work. If `~/.codex/hooks.json` already exists, a
`UserPromptSubmit` entry is added there as well.

Codex also works as an **execution backend** regardless of how recall is wired —
it is often the better choice for background compaction, since `codex exec
--ephemeral --output-schema` gives native structured output:

```bash
rose config agent codex
rose compact --due --agent codex
```

## What gets written

```
.rose/
  config.yaml        settings (see `rose config`)
  nodes/<family>/    lesson nodes — the tree. Worth committing.
  episodes/          the replay corpus. Worth committing.
  sessions/          per-session scratch. Machine-local.
  events.jsonl       telemetry. Machine-local.
  judge-cache.json   cached judgements. Machine-local.
  background.log     output from detached learning runs (`rose absorb`).
```

### Two scopes

If `~/.rose` exists it is layered underneath the project store. Lessons from both
are recalled; new ones are written to the project. This is how a cross-project
principle ("prefer the model's judgement over a similarity score") and a
repo-specific fact ("this suite needs `PAYMENTS_PG_PORT`") each live at the right
scope instead of one being in the wrong place.

```bash
rose init ~                      # create the global store
ROSE_HOME=~/.rose rose add "..."   # teach it something that follows you everywhere
```

Editing a global lesson from inside a repo writes back to the global store
rather than forking a local copy that then drifts.

`.rose/.gitignore` excludes `sessions/` and `events.jsonl` by default, so
committing `.rose/` shares the lessons and their regression corpus with your team
without the machine-local noise.

### Privacy

Everything written to disk passes through `redact.py` first: API keys, tokens,
private keys, card numbers and `secret=…` assignments are replaced with
`[REDACTED]`, and emails are reduced to their domain. It is deliberately biased
toward over-redaction — a mangled lesson is recoverable, a leaked key is not.

ROSE never sends anything anywhere. Model calls go to whichever CLI you already
have configured, with your existing credentials.

## Turning it off

```bash
rose config recall.enabled false       # stop injecting
rose config compaction.enabled false   # stop compressing
rose config learning.enabled false     # stop minting lessons
rose uninstall --target claude         # remove the hooks entirely
```

`ROSE_DISABLE=1` in the environment disables everything for a single run, which
is also how spawned child agents avoid recursing.
