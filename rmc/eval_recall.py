"""Measuring whether recall serves the right lessons.

Every other stage of RMC is checked against something. Compression replays the
episodes the lesson came from; a merge has to reproduce all its children's; a
delta earns its way back by rescuing a failure. Recall — the stage that decides
what enters the user's context on *every single prompt* — was checked against
nothing at all, and it is the one the user actually feels.

What it costs to get wrong is symmetric, and both directions hurt:

* Serve a lesson that does not bear on the work and you have spent the user's
  context on noise. On this store that came to 15,917 tokens across 57 prompts,
  against 313 tokens injected per prompt on average — most of what recall sent
  was never used.
* Drop a lesson that would have helped and the whole product claim fails. The
  point is that the next session is shorter than the last.

The ground truth is `episode.used`: the lessons a fork of the live session
judged to have actually borne on the work. It is imperfect — a judgement, made
once, about a session that has since ended — but it is a real observation of an
outcome rather than an assertion, and it is the same signal attribution already
runs on.

The one methodological care that matters: a lesson is only scored if it was
*served* in that episode. A lesson nobody was shown could not have been used, so
counting its absence from `used` as evidence against it would manufacture false
positives out of the retrieval decision. So each episode is replayed with
exactly the candidate set it saw, and the question is narrow and fair:

    given the lessons that were served, would the judge now drop the ones that
    turned out not to matter, and keep the ones that did?

    Two arms, and they do not face the same question — which is the point, and
    also the thing a reader of the numbers has to be told.

    ``judge`` replays each episode against **exactly the lessons it was served**.
    A lesson nobody was shown could not have been used, so counting its absence
    from `used` as evidence against it would manufacture false positives out of
    the retrieval decision. This is the baseline: 48% precision at 100% recall.

    ``agentic`` gives the selector the whole store and lets it search. The
    denominator is different by necessity — the candidate set genuinely is
    everything — and that cuts both ways. Recall can now exceed the judge's,
    because the judge could only ever pick from what an earlier version of
    retrieval had already chosen; and precision is measured against a much
    larger set of things it could have wrongly picked. The two columns are
    comparable as *outcomes* and not as *scores on one test*, so the report
    labels the arm rather than presenting them as like-for-like.

    The agentic arm here is also **cold**: a fresh process, no conversation in
    front of it. In production the selector forks the live session and has the
    task's tool calls and reasoning. So this arm is a floor on what agentic
    selection does, not an estimate of it.
