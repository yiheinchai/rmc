"""Hook entry points — the part that makes RMC ambient.

Two events carry the whole loop:

``user-prompt-submit``  inject the lessons that bear on this prompt
``stop``                nudge the agent to reflect, but only after a surprise
``session-end``         hand the session to a detached learner

Three rules govern everything here:

1. **Never block the user.** A hook that errors, hangs or prints garbage
   degrades someone's editor. Every path is wrapped and every failure exits 0.
   This binds hardest at session end: the host is tearing down and cancels a
   hook still running, so work that is slow there does not happen *at all*.
   Everything expensive is detached; only transcript parsing runs inline.
2. **Never recurse.** The background work spawns `claude`/`codex`, which would
   fire these same hooks. `RMC_CHILD=1` in the child environment stops that.
3. **Judgement is the model's.** Relevance is decided by a model call, cached
   by prompt, because injecting the wrong lesson is worse than injecting none
   and only a reader can tell the difference. Set `recall.enabled: false` if you
   would rather not pay for that on every prompt.

this and it is NOT a request to capture anything.

Look back over the turns you just did and find:

  **Every point where the user had to steer you.**

complaint about quality, a preference you did not know they held. Each one is a
round of the user's time that a better-informed agent would not have cost them.
That — not being wrong in the abstract — is the failure this check exists to
find.

For each, ask what you would have needed to know at the start to make that
correction unnecessary. It is usually one of these, and the first three are the
ones this check has historically missed:

  1. **A standard or preference this user holds** — what they consider good,
     how they want work presented, an aesthetic, a tone, a tool they expect.
  2. **A method they expect applied** — a check to run, a bar to clear, an
     order to work in, a perspective to take.
  3. **A quality bar** — the level of fidelity or polish at which they stop
     pushing back.
  4. **A false belief about a tool, language, platform or library.** This counts
     even though it surfaced as a bug. The test is whether a belief was wrong,
     not whether it arrived with an error message.
  5. **A false belief about this project.**
  6. **A modelling error** — you represented something in a way that is not true
     of it.

Then filter on usefulness rather than worthiness:

  (a) would knowing this at the start have removed at least one round of

  (b) does it apply to some task other than this exact file?
  (c) is it still true tomorrow?

If the agent ran `rmc add` itself during these turns, or the user asked why
something was not learned, treat that as a capture an earlier pass should have
made and did not. Say what about the criteria let it through.

Calibrate against the steering, not against a general prior. A session in which
the user never had to redirect you almost certainly teaches nothing — say so and
finish. A session in which they redirected you repeatedly almost certainly does,
and returning nothing from one is this check failing. Do not invent a lesson to

    cheapest kind of mistake. The expensive errors are conceptual: believing a

If it clears the bar:

    rmc add --family <slug> "<what to do, AND the wrong belief or blind spot \
it replaces>"

Record the blind spot as well as the correction. A lesson that states only the
right answer lets the next agent arrive at the same wrong assumption and merely
recognise the fix afterwards.

**If what you found is a defect in RMC itself** — the reflector missing what it
plainly should have caught, a stage that did not run, a command that reported
success while doing nothing — then the lesson belongs upstream, not only in this
store. Run `rmc report --about "..." --expected "..."`, which writes a redacted
report to disk and sends nothing, then ask the user whether they want it filed
as an issue. Ask; never file it yourself. Five hundred people hitting the same
defect and each fixing it locally teaches the project nothing.

**If the conversation shows the agent running `rmc add` itself, or the user
asking why something was not learned, that is a capture you failed to make.**
Not a lesson already handled — a miss. The evidence was in front of an earlier
reflection pass and it walked past. Read what was added, work out what about
these criteria let it through, and capture *that* in the `reflection` family. A
capture system that cannot see its own misses cannot improve.

**If the user had to tell you something that was already in a lesson you were
served, do not add it again.** That is not a gap in what is known — it is a
lesson that is not landing. Say so on your reply line, naming the node id, and
capture nothing.

Calibrate against the steering, not against a general prior. A session in which
the user never had to redirect you almost certainly teaches nothing — say so and
finish. A session in which they redirected you repeatedly almost certainly does,
and returning nothing from one is this check failing. Do not invent a lesson to

ATTRIBUTION = """Second, these lessons were recalled into this session before the work
started:

{served}

Say which of them actually bore on what happened — a lesson counts only if the
work would plausibly have gone differently without it. Being on-topic is not
being used; being read and found irrelevant is not being used. Be strict, and
note that having been *served* a lesson and then done the opposite means it was
not used.

You are better placed to answer this than anything else in the system: you hold
the actual context, so you can see a principle being applied and not merely a
command being run.

For the ones that were used, also say **what specific work they bore on** and
**what doing it correctly looked like**. That pair turns the use into a
replayable test: a fresh agent given that task and that lesson can be checked
against that outcome, which is the only evidence that ever lets a lesson be
compressed. Describe the actual task — not the session's opening request, which
by now has little to do with what just happened.

    rmc used --session {session} --used <ids> --unused <ids> \
      --task "<the specific work, one sentence>" \
      --outcome "<what doing it right looked like, one sentence>" \
      --load-bearing "<node id>:<the sentence or clause that did the work>"

Pass `--load-bearing` once per part of a lesson that actually changed what
happened — quote the specific sentence, not the whole lesson. A lesson is
usually one useful paragraph carried by four that were never needed, and this is
the only place that difference is ever observed. Compression uses it to cut the
rest; with nothing here it has to guess, which is what it used to do.

That is worth more than the answer itself, because it generalises: the store
keeps growing, and what stops selection getting slower is knowing where to look
rather than looking everywhere.

Write a rule if, and only if, one of these is true:

  * a lesson that mattered was **not** loaded, and there is a search that would
    have found it — name the search, not the lesson;
  * a lesson was loaded and turned out to be irrelevant, in a way that will
    recur for this *kind* of task;
  * you had to open several files to find one thing, and a shorter route exists.

    rmc route --when "<the kind of task, recognisable before the work starts>" \
      --then "<where to look, or what to stop opening>"

**The `--when` has to name a kind of task, and this is the whole of what makes
the rule worth storing.** "When the task touches the integration tests" is a
rule. "n_abc is rarely useful" is not — it is a fact about one lesson, there
would be one of them per lesson, and the layer that is supposed to stay small
becomes a second copy of the store. This was measured: annotating candidates
with their usage record made retrieval worse on both precision and recall,
because how often a lesson gets used is a statement about the distribution of
work rather than about the lesson.

Also say which rules you were shown that actually helped, and which sent you the
wrong way:

    rmc used --session {session} --rule-helped <ids> --rule-wasted <ids>

If selection went fine and there is no rule to write, say so and write nothing.
An unnecessary rule costs every future prompt.
