"""Every semantic judgement in RMC, in one place.

The harness supplies structure — a tree to walk, a budget to spend, a schema to
answer in, a cache so nothing is judged twice. It does not supply answers.
Questions about *meaning* — is this relevant, does this relate to that, is this
a contradiction, did this session go well — are decided by the model.

That line matters. Similarity of meaning does not live in token overlap, and an
intent classifier made of regexes silently caps the system at whatever a bag of
words can express. Where earlier versions of this file's callers used Jaccard
and phrase banks, they now ask.

What stays in code is the part that is genuinely structural:

* **whether to ask at all** — an empty store, an exhausted budget, or a session
  with two tool calls needs no judgement, and asking would be waste;
* **the walk** — which candidates are put in front of the model, and in what
  order, so the number of questions grows with the *depth* of the tree rather
  than its size;
* **the cache** — the same question is never paid for twice.

Efficiency comes from structure, not from cheap approximations of judgement.

A new lesson has just been learned. Before it is stored it must be checked

flagged as a contradiction rather than blindly appended.

For each remembered lesson below, say whether it covers the same ground:
  - `relevant`  — same subject. The two need reconciling, whether they agree,
                  one adds detail, or they contradict each other.
  - `maybe`     — possibly the same subject, but the summary is too abstract to
                  be sure. Set `descend: true` to see the detailed versions.
  - `unrelated` — different subject.

Same subject means *about the same thing in the world* — the same tool, command,
service, constraint or procedure — not merely similar wording. Two lessons that
both set an environment variable for the same service are the same subject even
if they share no other words. Two lessons that both mention "retry" may be about
entirely different systems.

Look especially for lessons that assign a different value to something this new
lesson also assigns: a port, a flag, a path, a command. Those are the
contradictions that matter most and the easiest to miss.

`global` — it would be true for anyone using these tools, languages, services or

engineering judgement, or how you should work.

The test is not what the lesson was *discovered* in — almost everything is
discovered inside some project. Ask instead: if someone opened a completely
unrelated repository tomorrow and hit this same tool or service, would this
lesson still be right and still be useful? If yes, it is `global`.

Getting this wrong is asymmetric. A global lesson filed as project-scoped
becomes invisible everywhere else and can never be found again from the place it
would have helped most. A project lesson filed as global is merely noise, and
noise is recoverable.

A lesson has been compressed. Decide whether the shorter version is worth

it is an *improvement*.

A candidate earns its place on either of two axes:

1. **It costs less.** Fewer tokens on every future recall, with nothing
   important lost.
2. **It is more general.** It states at a higher level what the original said
   about one case, so it now covers situations the original did not. This can be
   worth keeping even when the token saving is small — an abstraction that
   applies to five situations instead of one is more valuable per token, and
   token count cannot see that.

Refuse it when: it saves little AND generalises nothing (a reworded copy); or it
became shorter by becoming vaguer, so an agent reading it would no longer know
what to actually do. Vagueness is not generality. "Handle errors properly" is
shorter and broader than a specific retry rule and is worth nothing.

Read this record of a finished coding session and judge how it went. You are not
reviewing the work; you are deciding what can be learned from it.

`outcome` — did the session end with the task correctly done? Judge the end
state, not the path taken. Work that failed several times and was then fixed
ended in success.

`corrected` — did the *human* have to steer the agent away from a wrong
approach? This is a separate question from the outcome, and both can be true: a
session can end perfectly precisely because the user intervened. Be careful not
to read a user's clarification, extra request, or change of mind as a
correction; a correction means the agent was going the wrong way.

`discoveries` — what did the agent work out by trial, with no human help? A
command that failed and a different one that worked; a test that rejected an
approach; an API that behaved unexpectedly. For each, record what failed and
*why*, and what worked. These are the most valuable thing in most sessions,
because they let the next agent skip the detour entirely. An identical command
retried until it succeeded is flakiness, not a discovery.

`lessons_used` — the lessons below were injected into this session before the
work started. For each, say whether it actually *bore on* what happened.

Be strict, and default to `false`. A lesson counts as used only if the work
would plausibly have gone differently without it: it supplied a fact that was
acted on, ruled out an approach, or named a constraint that was respected.
Being on-topic is not being used. Being read and found irrelevant is not being
used. If the same result would have followed without it, it was not used.

This matters more than it looks. These verdicts decide which lessons get credit
for the outcome, and which get abstracted together into a shared parent. Marking
everything used means an irrelevant lesson accrues a record of usefulness it did
not earn, and unrelated lessons get merged because they happened to be shown at
the same time.

`confidence` — be honest. A short session with no clear signal is `unknown` with
low confidence, and that is a perfectly good answer. A wrong label is worse than
no label, because it is used to decide which memories are trusted.
