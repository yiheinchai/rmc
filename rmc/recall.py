"""Retrieval: pick the lessons a prompt needs, and build a context pack.

Two entry points:

``recall_pack``  — ambient path, run from the prompt hook. Asks the model which
                   remembered lessons bear on this work, walking the tree from
                   the most abstract nodes downward.

``solve_with_descent`` — controlled path, used by replay and evaluation, where
                   RMC owns the loop and can observe a failure, diagnose it, and
                   descend the tree mid-task.

Relevance and repair are both judgements about meaning and are made by the
model (see ``judge.py``). What lives here is the shape of the search and the
budget it may spend.
